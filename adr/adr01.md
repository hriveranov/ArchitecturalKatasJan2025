# Fine tunning of the model.
The model must be adapted to respond as the experts would. 

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Generating new models is expensive and fine tuning them is not guaranteed to yield better results, 
and would require great amounts of data. There are other places where the model can be tunned that
may prove to be more useful and less costly.

## Decision
The prompt and context will be updated with examples and material.

## Consequences
The cost of influencing the output of the model is low.
The expert group will take on also the responsibility of evaluating the model and tunning the context.

## Compliance
