# Break evaluation criteria into small items
Case studies involve a large analysis that involves several different criteria.

## Status
Proposed

## Context
LLMs are good at answering small targeted questions, but not so good at answering
large, less concrete questions.

## Decision
For case studies, the question will be evaluated using several aspects required
for each.

## Consequences
Experts creating each case will have to provide the different aspects to be evaluated
and their value in the total evaluation of the case study

## Compliance

## Notes
This will require a modification to the interface where the experts create and update 
case studies.
